# 20 apps in 20 weeks

My name is Per. I'm a software developer from Copenhagen, Denmark.

Currently I'm working for [NNIT](http://www.nnit.com/) - one of Denmarks leading consultancies in IT development, implementation and operations. I've been employed for a year, and mainly I've been allocated to a project for [Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark](http://en.mfvm.dk/the-ministry/). That involves coding primarily in C# .NET, T-SQL and JavaScript.


My previous job was as an iOS developer for the company [CubeIO](https://cubeio.com/). As the only iOS developer in the company at that time, I alone was responsible for the  for the core product of the company. A Visual Voicemail.
For various personal reasons, I decided to look for new challenges - which led me to NNIT.

As I write this, I haven't written a line of Swift code in more than a year and I must admit, that I actually miss it. Since then Swift has changed from version 2 to version 3.

Therefor I've decided to give myself a challenge - as the titles states. Write 20 apps in 20 weeks.
