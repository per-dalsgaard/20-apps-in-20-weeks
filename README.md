# 20 apps in 20 weeks

My name is Per. I'm a software developer from Copenhagen, Denmark.

Currently I'm working for [NNIT](http://www.nnit.com/) - one of Denmarks leading consultancies in IT development, implementation and operations. I've been employed for a year, and mainly I've been allocated to a project for [Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark](http://en.mfvm.dk/the-ministry/). That involves coding primarily in C# .NET, T-SQL and JavaScript.


My previous job was as an iOS developer for the company [CubeIO](https://cubeio.com/). As the only iOS developer in the company at that time, I alone was responsible for the  for the core product of the company. A Visual Voicemail.
For various personal reasons, I decided to look for new challenges - which led me to NNIT.

As I write this, I haven't written a line of Swift code in more than a year and I must admit, that I actually miss it. Since then Swift has changed from version 2 to version 3.

Therefor I've decided to give myself a challenge - as the titles states. Write 20 apps in 20 weeks.

I'm not going to come up with 20 apps myself. What I'll do instead is to find, what I see as the best resources available on the internet covering iOS development, and follow along with the instructor or tutor building various more or less interesting applications, to get me up to speed with iOS development again - and a feel for the latest trends on the platform.
